                    <h3>Settup Strong Password</h3>
                    <p>Always use a strong password for important websites and for your email. The requirement for a strong password is:</p>
                    <ul class="strong-password-requirements">
                        <li>The password has to be at least 12 characters long.</li>
                        <li>It needs to have at least one number, small letter, big letter and a special character</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Your password must not contain any personal data(such as your name, banking details or age). Like this even if your password gets stollen a hacker wouldn't know anything for you from it.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Use Different Unique passwords</h3>
                    <p>For every site which has your personal data use a different and unique password. And never use the same password for less important sites. In this way if a hacker gets a password for a less important site, he couldn't use it to get your personal data.</p>
                    <p>If you are having a hard time making unique passwords you can use an online site or a password manager</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Use Multy Factor Authentication</h3>
                    <p>Multifactor authentication (MFA) is an authentication method that asks users to provide two or more verification methods to access an online account. Some of the  methods are:</p>
                    <ul class="authentMethods">
                        <li>A one time password which is being sent to the user's email</li>
                        <li>The password or fingerprint for the device</li>
                        <li>Answer to personal questions</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>It's very useful because even if a hacker gets your password, he still will need to go through the authentication. Which might prevent him from stealing anything</p>
