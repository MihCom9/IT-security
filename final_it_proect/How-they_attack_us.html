        <h1>How Hackers Hack Us</h1>
        <p class="idea">
            Hackers employ various methods to gain unauthorized access to systems and data. Here are three different
            ways
            they can attack us:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h2>
                    Cracking Wi-Fi Passwords
                </h2>
                <p> Hackers can crack Wi-Fi passwords using several techniques:</p>

                <p> <strong class="strong2"> Dictionary Attack:</strong> Hackers use a precompiled list of commonly used
                    passwords and
                    systematically test each one against the Wi-Fi network until they find a match.
                </p>
                <p> <strong class="strong2">Brute Force Attack:</strong> They try every possible combination of
                    characters until they
                    successfully guess the password. This method can be time-consuming but effective against weak
                    passwords.
                </p>
                <p> <strong class="strong2"> WPS Attack: </strong> Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) is a feature intended to
                    simplify the
                    process of connecting devices to a secure wireless network. However, it has vulnerabilities that
                    hackers can exploit to gain access to the network.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h2>
                    Brute Forcing Email Passwords
                </h2>
                <p> Brute force attacks involve systematically guessing passwords until the correct one is found:</p>

                <p> <strong class="strong2"> Automated Tools:</strong> Hackers use automated tools that can rapidly test
                    millions of
                    password combinations.
                </p>
                <p> <strong class="strong2">Credential Stuffing:</strong> Using stolen username and password pairs from
                    previous data
                    breaches, hackers attempt to gain access to other accounts that might use the same credentials.
                </p>

            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>
                    Breaking into Phones
                </h2>
                <p>Hackers can compromise phones through various methods without the user's knowledge:</p>

                <p> <strong class="strong2"> Phishing:</strong> Hackers send deceptive messages (via SMS, email, or
                    social media) that
                    trick users into clicking malicious links or downloading malware.

                <p id="hbutton" class="word1" onclick="my1Function()">Learn more about Phishing ></p>

                <div id="myDIV" style="display: none;">
                    <p>Phishing is a method where hackers trick users into revealing sensitive information:

                    <p> <strong class="strong1">Email Phishing: </strong> Hackers send emails that appear to be from
                        trusted sources, prompting users to click on malicious links or download infected attachments.
                    </p>
                    <p> <strong class="strong1"> Whaling:</strong> This targets high-profile individuals like executives
                        or celebrities, with emails tailored to their interests or responsibilities.
                    </p>
                    <p> <strong class="strong1"> Smishing and Vishing:</strong> Similar to email phishing, but using SMS
                        (smishing) or voice calls (vishing) to deceive victims into providing personal information or
                        performing certain actions. </p>
                    </p>
                </div>
                </p>
                <p> <strong class="strong2"> Malware:</strong> Installing malicious apps can give hackers control over a
                    phone. They can
                    install spyware to monitor activities, keyloggers to capture keystrokes, or ransomware to lock the
                    phone and demand payment. </p>


                <p> <strong class="strong2"> SIM Swapping: :</strong> HHackers trick or bribe mobile carriers into
                    transferring the
                    victim's phone number to a SIM card they control. This can allow them to intercept SMS-based
                    two-factor authentication codes and gain access to the victim’s accounts. </p>

            </li>
        </ol>
        <p style="color:black">
            Stay informed, use strong passwords, and be cautious online to protect yourself from cyber threats.
        </p>
